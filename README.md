Tired of your Hungry Frog eating that monster you were trying to loot? Grinding for Dragon's Teeth and your hopping friend keeps eating the Lava Lurk at the last second? There's a solution! Froggy Filter!

Froggy Filter is a mod that lets you configure EXACTLY which monsters the hungry frog companion is allowed to eat.

![Installation Image](Images/Nexus/installation.png)  
The only hard requirement for this mod is an up-to-date installation of SMAPI. Just unzip into your mods folder and configure as you see fit.
Installing GMCM (Generic Mod Config Menu) is recommended to easily edit the configuration file in-game, although you CAN technically edit the JSON yourself, I wouldn't advise it.

Configuration with GMCM is incredibly easy, just go through the list and check the boxes you WANT the frog to eat, and uncheck the boxes that you DON'T want the frog to eat.

Compatibility is **reasonably** guaranteed with anything from ContentPatcher. I haven't tested extensively, but as long as it patches the game's Monster Data it'll be hooked in.

Other mods are more difficult, such as custom spawns added through FTM. This includes some of the monsters from SVE which are just reskinned versions of existing monsters in the base game. As of now there's no good way to differentiate them, but if you uncheck the type they are under the hood (e.g. SVE Poltergeist in the swamp is just a reskinned Pepper Rex) it should work just fine.
